# Advent of Code 2022

I've never used Kotlin before so this is a learning experience first and foremost! If I have thoughts I will write them here.

### Day 1

I was apparently wrong to think that for-loops would have the same syntax as Java, but aside from that hiccup not much to say
here.

### Day 2

Apparently Kotlin doesn't have ternary expressions, or switch statements! The more you know, huh. I'm also still
unclear how the forEach syntax works; I expected it to be like Java where it expects a lambda like
`foo.forEach(bar -> bar.baz())`, but that was not actually correct.
